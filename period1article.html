        <h2>Back to School: Turku International School and Turun Normaalikoulu Begin a New Year</h2>
        <p>
            Students at Turku International School and Turun Normaalikoulu are back in class after the summer holidays, and the school year has officially begun. 
            For the pre-Diploma Programme (DP) students, this year marks the beginning of their high school journey, while the DP2 students are starting their final year before graduation. 
            Here at Norssi News, we’re committed to keeping the community updated on school events, academic milestones, and helpful tips for International Baccalaureate (IB) students. 
            We wish all students a productive year ahead and hope they surpass their academic goals!
        </p>
        
        <h2>Celebrating TJ100: A Finnish High School Tradition</h2>
        <p>
            On September 6, Turun Normaalikoulun Lukio marked a significant annual tradition: TJ100, celebrating the milestone of only 100 days left before the Finnish matriculation exams. 
            Third-year students, known as “Abis” or seniors, joined in a day filled with camaraderie and lighthearted fun. Dressed in Wild West attire, they playfully "rounded up" first and 
            second-year students, marking them with lipstick to match the theme of sheriffs and outlaws.
        </p>
        <p>
            As part of the festivities, seniors organized a series of activities in the auditorium. The underclassmen took on various challenges, such as navigating an obstacle course where 
            they had to shout a word each time they cleared a hurdle. Teachers, secretly nominated by students, joined in on a fun limbo competition, and audience members had a chance 
            to participate in a “Hole in the Wall” game, testing their agility and humor. The celebration concluded with western-themed music as the seniors made their exit, 
            leaving the school buzzing with excitement.
        </p>
        
        <h2>The First Exam Week of the Year</h2>
        <p>
            The first examination week has just wrapped up, and it was a crucial period for many students adjusting to the demands of high school assessments. 
            In these three-hour exams, students needed to demonstrate focused writing, quick thinking, and effective time management. 
            Exam weeks can be particularly challenging, with common pitfalls like time mismanagement, grammar oversights, and misinterpreting questions. 
            Mistakes, however, are a valuable learning experience and a chance for students to refine their strategies for future assessments.
