        <h2>What is Wanhat?</h2>
        <p>
            Wanhat is a traditional event celebrated by high school students in Finland, typically during their second year. The term "Wanhat" means "the elderly" in Finnish, representing the students taking over the role as the oldest in the school once the seniors leave to prepare for their matriculation exams.
        </p>

        <h2>The Dance</h2>
        <p>
            A highlight of the Wanhat celebration is the formal ballroom dance, "Vanhojen Tanssit" or "The Dance of the Old." Students dress in elegant ball gowns and tuxedos, performing classical dances like the waltz in front of their families, friends, and teachers. This event is a significant part of the tradition and often requires weeks of rehearsals.
        </p>

        <h2>Preparation for the Event</h2>
        <p>
            Months before Wanhat, students begin their preparations by learning choreographed dance routines and choosing their attire. Elegant dresses and formal suits are carefully selected, with many students getting their hair and makeup done professionally for the big day.
        </p>

        <h2>Why is Wanhat Special?</h2>
        <p>
            Wanhat marks a symbolic transition from adolescence to adulthood, representing the students’ seniority in school and the nearing end of their high school journey. For many students, it’s a once-in-a-lifetime experience filled with excitement, tradition, and pride.
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            The Wanhat tradition holds a special place in Finnish high schools, blending elegance, cultural heritage, and celebration. It is an opportunity for students to shine and create lasting memories before the demands of final exams and graduation take over.
